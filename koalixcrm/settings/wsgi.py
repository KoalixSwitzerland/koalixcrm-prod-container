WSGI config for koalixcrm project.

This module contains the WSGI application used by Django's development server
and any production WSGI deployments. It should expose a module-level variable
named `application`. Django's `runserver` and `runfcgi` commands discover
this application via the `WSGI_APPLICATION` setting.

Usually this will be called "koalixcrm.wsgi".
